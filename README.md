# Offline CRM - Chrome Browser Plugin

## Prompt Used

Help me create a CRM chrome browser extension. Add, edit, and delete people.

Each person will have a Name (First Name, Last Name), Profile Url, Email Address, Company, Position, Date Connected On.

Each person / card should have the option to edit the person (card), or delete the person (card).

There should be an option to create and a new person manually.

Also, allow users to upload their exported LinkedIn connections (see attached) from a CSV file. Users should see each person imported as a card. Imported data should be saved with the extension to persist for future use.

The cards of imported and manually created people should be displayed together on a dashboard tab, not on the menu popup.

No not use any external libraries.
